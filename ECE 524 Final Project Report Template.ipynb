Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation) where appropriate) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and/or any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated? something you have collected personally, or by surveying your friends?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",

You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **We will be running your code, and you want to make sure that everything works if we run the code blocks in sequence**. Having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks (either as separate cells or blocks of comments) that explain the various parts of your solution will make it much easier for us to understand your project. \n",
